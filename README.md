# 4chan parser
## What?
The title is pretty self-descriptive.

As of now it only prints things out, rather than really parsing it.

## Why?
For fun, and because 4chan's markup is some of the ugliest stuff I've ever seen.

## How?
`curl` or `wget` a page from any 4chan board, name it `page.html`, and run `parse.rb`.

This is a work in progress.
